# C4-SiriusXM-EZR

A simple Control4 IR driver for the SiriusXM Onyx EZR. While most users will prefer internet streaming, this driver is ideal for:

- Grandfathered SiriusXM accounts  
- Dealer trial units  
- Scenarios with unstable internet connections  

It allows continued access to SiriusXM content via IR control.

This driver can also be combined with **Source Pooling** for setups with multiple devices:

> **Note:**  
> Power controls are not included. The SiriusXM EZR unit is assumed to always be powered on to avoid desynchronization between the device state and Control4.
