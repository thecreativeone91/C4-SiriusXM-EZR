# C4-SiriusXM-EZR

Simple Control4 IR Driver for the SiriusXM EZR. Most people will use internet streaming however this is a good option for those with grandfathered accounts, dealer free trials or unstable internet to be able to enjoy music. 

Can be combined with Source Pooling for multiples (https://drivercentral.io/platforms/control4-drivers/audio-video/source-pooling/) 

No power controls, the device is left always on to prevent power states from getting out of sync.

In the Driver Settings map the Pound # to Direct, when channing channels via a remote or touchscreen use #channel (ex: #46) to change to that channel. Channel up/down and menu/navigation options are fully working.
